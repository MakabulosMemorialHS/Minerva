PROGRAMMER'S NOTES

4 June 2017
-------------------------------------------------------------
 -- Started Project. Named it after Minerva, the Roman Goddess of
    Knowledge and Wisdom. The objective of this little program
    is for controlling my dead tree library.

 -- Objectives are modest. I want to be able to search by title,
    author, or topic. Minerva should tell me where to find it.
    I don't want to learn the Dewey Decimal System in depth so
    I am not targetting this program to be full DDS compliant.
